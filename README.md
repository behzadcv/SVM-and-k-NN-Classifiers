In this project, we aimed to predict the outcome of an election for a set of candidates based on the answers to a set of predefined questions as well as the properties of comments about each candidate by using an ensemble of support vector machine classifiers. Moreover, for each candi- date, we predicted the political party, which he/she belongs to by using a k-nearest neighborhood classifier. The experimental results showed that these classifiers with a set of properly selected features are able to pre- dict the election outcomes and political parties of the candidates with a convenient accuracy.
